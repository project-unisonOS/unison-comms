# Security

This repository hosts the UnisonOS communications service. It is designed to be edge-first, keeping connectors and tokens local to the person’s environment.

For overall security and privacy guidance (including how wake-word, “always-on”, and connector behaviors are controlled), see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you believe you have found a security issue in this service or its connectors, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub instead of filing a public issue.
